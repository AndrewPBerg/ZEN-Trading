I am wnat to expand my skills in frontend development, particularly by learning React Native and building a robust authentication 
flow using state management (such as Redux) and JWT. While I am comfortable with backend technologies, Docker, and Git, I see frontend 
development as the area where I have the most room to grow. I am also open to contributing to QA tasks, although my primary interest does 
not lie in that area.
