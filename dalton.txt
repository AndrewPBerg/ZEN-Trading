My name is Dalton Boone, and I have a particular interest with the algorithmic and structural inner-workings of programs.
I quite enjoyed Discrete Structures when I took it and being a double major with mathematics, I assumed that taking the role of the Backend developer would be the best fit.
I am currently in CSCI 431 so I will be able to utilize that class while working on my project in this one. 
I have alot of room to grow in every department, but keeping in mind my strength and intrest in statistics, Backend development would work best with my skillsets
